# Edible-Mushrooms-Identificator---Machine-Learning--GT

(Result presentation)

During a course at GeorgiaTech (ECE6254 - Statistical Machine Learning) in 2018, I worked in team to model a machine learning method to detect edible mushrooms. 
The dataset was composed of different mushroom characteristics. We implemented several algorithms in Pyhton to find the best approach to respond to our problematics.
